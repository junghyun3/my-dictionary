# My Dictionary

I frequently use [올ㅋ사전](http://allkdic.xoul.kr/), but it does not provide another dictionary that I also frequently use, and I cannot add new dictionary, so I made it.

This app is built with [Electron](https://electronjs.org/) and [photon](http://photonkit.com).

Much code is from [tray-example](https://github.com/kevinsawicki/tray-example), [electron-bookmark](https://github.com/2woongjae/electron-bookmark) and dependency projects.

Dictionary icon is from [electron-bookmark](https://github.com/2woongjae/electron-bookmark).

## Running

```sh
git clone https://github.com/junghyun87/my-dictionary
cd my-dictionary
npm install
npm start
```

## Packaging

```sh
npm run package
open out/my-dictionary-darwin-x64/my-dictionary.app
```
